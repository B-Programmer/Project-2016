The wizard has built 9 cab(s) for your application. The cabs are in 'C:\StudentReg\Package'.

There is also a batch file in the support directory (C:\StudentReg\Package\Support\Stdprj.BAT) that will allow you to recreate the cab files in case you make changes to some of the files.

You have included mdac_typ.exe in your installation package.  If you will be installing this package on a Windows 95/98 system, it will require DCOM98 to install properly.
